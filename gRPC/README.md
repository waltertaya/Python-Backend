# gRPC

- gRPC is a modern, open-source, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It enables efficient communication between services in and across data centers, with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication.

## Key Characteristics:

- Binary Protocol: gRPC uses a binary protocol, Protocol Buffers (protobuf), for message serialization, which provides efficient data compression and faster processing.
- Strongly-Typed: gRPC is strongly typed, ensuring that client and server code are consistent and reducing errors.
- HTTP/2: gRPC uses HTTP/2 as the underlying transport protocol, enabling multiplexing, header compression, and stream prioritization for improved performance.
- Cross-Language Support: gRPC provides libraries for multiple programming languages, including Android Java, C#, C++, Dart, Go, Java, Kotlin/JVM, Node.js, Objective-C, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
- Open Source: gRPC is open-source, allowing for community-driven development and customization.
